 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.547   TIME= 12:23:42
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.703   TIME= 12:23:42
 SOLID185 wedges are recommended only in regions of relatively low       
 stress gradients.                                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 12:23:42
 Material number 2 (used by element 58637) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.891   TIME= 12:23:44
 The PCG solver detects that the stiffness matrix has one or more        
 negative pivots.  The solution has not converged.  Please check for     
 rigid body motions in your model.                                       
                                                                         

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       6.391   TIME= 12:23:47
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UX   
 degree of freedom of node 26047).  Please check for an insufficiently   
 constrained model.
