first solve:
equiv.stress = 3.9389 MPa
max.deformation = 0.0082569 mm

2nd solve w smaller mesh around hole:
equiv.stress = 3.7849 MPa       (slightly less for larger sphere) (3.75 for linear)
max.deformation = 0.0082606 mm  (same for larger sphere)          (slightly less for linear)



warnign for wrong BC's:
Not enough constraints appear to be applied to prevent rigid body motion.  
This may lead to solution warnings or errors.  Check results carefully.
